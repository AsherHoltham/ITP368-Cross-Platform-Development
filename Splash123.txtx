This is your first lab with navigation (between pages of an app).

You are given an app that has 2 pages, with navigation between 
then.

You should add a 3rd page, and be able to get to it from
both existing pages.  

Can you get from page 3 to page 2, back and forth, without
piling up duplicates on the stack?

I am actually giving you 3 different versions of the app.
Use whichever works for you, or try them all.
